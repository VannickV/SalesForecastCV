# Sales Forecasting with Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a time series-based approach to predict future sales. By analyzing historical sales data, the model identifies trends and seasonal patterns to make accurate forecasts. The primary objective is to help businesses plan and make informed decisions based on data-driven predictions.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values.
   - Visualized data trends and seasonal patterns.

2. **Time Series Modeling**:
   - Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Implemented the SARIMAX model for forecasting future sales.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Requirements
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `statsmodels`
